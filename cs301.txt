Aggregation

2efcde9
Aggregation is a form of relationship between two classes where one class:
option: Inherits from the other class
option dabfac4: Contains an instance of the other class
option: Has a parent-child relationship with the other class
option: Shares static members with the other class

2efcde9
Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the aggregated class and the containing class?
option: The aggregated class is a specialized form of the containing class.
option dabfac4: The aggregated class is a part/component of the containing class.
option: The aggregated class is a subclass of the containing class.
option: The aggregated class is an interface implemented by the containing class.

2efcde9
Aggregation represents a(n) _________ relationship between classes.
option: Inheritance
option: Composition
option dabfac4: Association
option: Encapsulation

b94d27b
In an aggregation relationship, the lifetime of the aggregated object is independent of the containing object.
option: True
option dabfac4: False

b94d27b
Aggregation implies a "whole-part" relationship, where the parts can exist independently of the whole.
option dabfac4: True
option: False

b94d27b
Aggregation allows circular references between classes, creating complex dependencies.
option dabfac4: True
option: False

Composition

2efcde9
Composition is a form of relationship between two classes where one class
option: Inherits from the other class

option: Arrays can store elements of different data types.
option: The size of an array can be changed after it is declared.
option dabfac4: Arrays are always passed to functions by value.
option: Arrays automatically adjust their size to accommodate additional elements.

2efcde9
Which of the following best defines an array?
option: An ordered collection of elements of different data types
option: A collection of unordered key-value pairs
