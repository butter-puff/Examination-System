Inheritance

2efcde9
Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class to:
option dabfac4: Access private members of another class
option: Create multiple instances of itself
option: Share properties and methods with other classes
option: Override all the methods of its parent class

2efcde9
Which of the following keywords is used to implement inheritance in C++?
option: extend
option dabfac4: public
option: inherit
option: derive

2efcde9
When a class inherits from another class, the inherited class is called the:
option: Derived class
option dabfac4: Base class
option: Parent class
option: Subclass

b94d27b
Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from multiple other classes.
option: True
option dabfac4: False

b94d27b
A derived class can access private members (variables and functions) of its base class.
option dabfac4: False
option: True

b94d27b
Multiple inheritance is a feature in which a class can inherit from more than one base class.
option: True
option dabfac4: False

Aggregation

2efcde9
Aggregation is a form of relationship between two classes where one class:
option: Inherits from the other class
option dabfac4: Contains an instance of the other class
option: Has a parent-child relationship with the other class
option: Shares static members with the other class

2efcde9
Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the aggregated class and the containing class?
option: The aggregated class is a specialized form of the containing class.
option dabfac4: The aggregated class is a part/component of the containing class.
option: The aggregated class is a subclass of the containing class.
option: The aggregated class is an interface implemented by the containing class.

2efcde9
Aggregation represents a(n) _________ relationship between classes.
option: Inheritance
option: Composition
option dabfac4: Association
option: Encapsulation

b94d27b
In an aggregation relationship, the lifetime of the aggregated object is independent of the containing object.
option: True
option dabfac4: False

b94d27b
Aggregation implies a "whole-part" relationship, where the parts can exist independently of the whole.
option dabfac4: True
option: False

b94d27b
Aggregation allows circular references between classes, creating complex dependencies.
option dabfac4: True
option: False

Composition

2efcde9
Composition is a form of relationship between two classes where one class
option: Inherits from the other class
option dabfac4: Contains an instance of the other class
option: Has a parent
option: Doesn't inherit

Which of the following is NOT a valid C++ variable name?
option: Arrays can store elements of different data types.
option: The size of an array can be changed after it is declared.
option dabfac4: Arrays are always passed to functions by value.
option: Arrays automatically adjust their size to accommodate additional elements.

2efcde9
Which of the following best defines an array?
option: An ordered collection of elements of different data types
option: A collection of unordered key-value pairs
option dabfac4: A data structure that stores elements of the same data type with a fixed size
option: A data type used to store characters only

b94d27b
In C++, the size of a character variable is always 1 byte.
option dabfac4: True
option: False

b94d27b

option dabfac4: True
option: False
