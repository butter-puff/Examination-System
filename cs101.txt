What is a pointer in C++?
option dabfac4: A variable that stores the address of another variable
option: A variable that stores the value of another variable
option: A keyword used to allocate memory dynamically
option: A keyword used to declare arrays

Which option correctly represents the output of accessing a specific range of elements in an array?
option: The elements within the specified range are removed from the array.
option dabfac4: The elements within the specified range are extracted and returned as a new array.
option: The elements within the specified range are replaced with a default value.
option: An error is thrown since arrays do not support accessing specific ranges.
